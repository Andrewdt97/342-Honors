what do we have:

DemandCalc (seasonal demand + current orders)
BOMComponentNeeds (all demanded products broken into subparts with total qty required)


ExpectedInv (current inventory + incoming orders)

old tables:

	if object_id('BOM_setup') is null
		create table BOM_setup (pID int, cID int, qty int, lvl int)

	if object_id('BOM_final_qtys') is null
		create table BOM_final_qtys (pID int, cID int, qty int)

old cursor code:

		insert into BOM_setup
		exec getBOM @myID, @startDate

		insert into BOM_final_qtys
		exec BOM_CTE @myID

		if exists (select 1 from BOM_setup)
		begin
			insert into #temp
			select cID, qty * @initialQty from BOM_final_qtys
			where cID not in (select pID from BOM_setup)
		end

		else
		begin
			insert into #temp (ID, qty)
			values (@myID, @initialQty)
		end

		delete from BOM_setup
		delete from BOM_final_qtys
